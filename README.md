##Text Tools: 
* [Letter Count](https://www.lettercount.com/): This tool will count the characters or words in a block of text. I use it for creating strings with a specific character count when I test text fields.

##JSON Tools: 
* [Pretty Print](http://jsonprettyprint.com/)]: JSON objects need indentation to be easily readable. This tool will take care of all of the indentation and spacing for you. This is especially helpful when you receive flattened JSON in a response and you want to be able to read through it.
* [Online JSON Viewer](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/): This tool will flatten your JSON for you by removing all the white spaces, which is helpful when you need to use your JSON in code.
* [JSON Lint](https://jsonlint.com/): I use this tool whenever I’m using JSON in a test and getting 400 errors. I paste the JSON into the tool and it will tell me whether my JSON is valid. If it’s not valid, it shows me the line with the error.
* [JSON Editor online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/) : To Edit the JSON online and view the JSON in easy format

[GUID Test and Validate](http://guid.us/Test/GUID): I use this tool to check GUIDs to make sure that they are valid.

#Miscellaneous Tools:
* [Rubular](https://rubular.com/r/bsCRGzMcYE): This is a regex editor that allows you to put in a regex, add a string to test, and find out whether your string matches the regex. It is specifically designed for Ruby but can be used with other languages as well.
* [NumVerify](https://numverify.com/): This tool is helpful when you are testing international phone numbers. It lets you know whether a given number is valid, and which country it is valid in.
* [WePay Testing](https://developer.wepay.com/docs/articles/testing): I use this site when I need a fake bank account to test with. It also lists fake credit card numbers for use in testing. Some of the features may be specific to Chase Bank.
* [Online Random File Generator](https://pinetools.com/random-file-generator): When you need to test files of a very specific size, this tool uses random strings to generate a file with exactly the size you need.
